Description:
    A generator to create new request paths quickly.
    By default, it generates a simple form that looks like the general request.

Example:
    rails generate request MyThingRequest

    This will create:
        lib/support/requests/my_thing_request.rb
        test/unit/support/requests/my_thing_request_test.rb
        
        app/controllers/my_thing_requests_controller.rb
        
        lib/zendesk/ticket/my_thing_request_ticket.rb
        
        app/views/my_thing_requests/new.html.erb
        app/views/my_thing_requests/_request_details.html.erb

        features/my_thing_requests.feature

TODO after running generator:
    Add the new request to 'support/requests.rb'
    Add the new request to 'request_groups.rb'
