      # Zendesk tickets are created with a generic `technical_fault`
      # tag as well as a tag of the form `fault_with_*`, where * is a
      # key from this hash, e.g. `fault_with_collections_publisher`.
      #
      # By default, all `technical_fault` tagged tickets are triaged
      # to `GOV.UK 2nd Line--Alerts and Issues` via this trigger:
      # https://govuk.zendesk.com/admin/objects-rules/rules/triggers/35985647
      #
      # Tickets may be triaged elsewhere if there is another trigger
      # looking for the `fault_with_*` tag. Therefore, when editing
      # the following hash, you should always check whether there is
      # a corresponding trigger to add/remove/edit. Search all triggers:
      # https://govuk.zendesk.com/admin/objects-rules/rules/triggers/
