  In order to allow departments to shift responsibilities around
  As a departmental user manager
  I want to request GDS tool access or new permissions for other users

    Then the following ticket is raised in ZenDesk:
      | Subject          | Requester email      |
      | New user account | john.smith@email.com |
    And the ticket is tagged with "govt_form create_new_user"
