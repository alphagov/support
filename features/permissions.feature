Feature: Request permissions
  To avoid confusion from requests raised by unauthorised individuals
  As the user support manager
  I want to prevent certain roles from raising certain request types

  Scenario: permissions per role (part 1)
    * The role/request matrix:
    | Role                   | Content requesters | Campaign requesters | Single points of contact |
    | Analytics              | Y                  | Y                   | Y                        |
    | Campaign               | N                  | Y                   | Y                        |
    | Content change         | Y                  | N                   | Y                        |
    | Unpublish content      | Y                  | Y                   | Y                        |
    | Create or change user  | N                  | N                   | Y                        |
    | General                | Y                  | Y                   | Y                        |

    | Problem report         | N                  | N                   | Y                        |
    | Named contact          | N                  | N                   | Y                        |
